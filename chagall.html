            <b>Music</b> played an essential role in shaping Chagall's art and life.
            <br> Marc Chagall was a Belorussian-born French artist whose work generally was based on emotional
            association rather than traditional
            pictorial fundamentals.
            <br> During the Second World War, he was persecuted and suffered from many injustices. Yet throughout such
            upheaval, music remained a constant source of inspiration for Chagall, both for his compositions and the
            intensity and
            range of colors used in his sweeping body of work.
            <br> He is known for his bold and colorful brush strokes resulting in a unique and distinctive style
            it was his colors which attracted and captured the viewer's attention.
            <br><br>"<i>The colors are a living, integral part of the picture
                and are never passively flat, or banal like an afterthought. They sculpt and animate the volume of the
                shapes</i>".
            <br><br>Chagall loved <i><b>Bach</b></i> and <i><b>Mozart</b></i>, but it was the music of his small
            <b>Hasidic
                Jewish</b> community near Vitebsk,
            Russia, that first influenced him.
            <br><br>
            Here are some Hasidic songs and some of his masterpieces below.

            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-sm-8" style="font-family:'Cormorant Infant', serif; font-weight: 500; font-size: 30px;">
                    "<i><b>Over the town</b></i>" is an important painting to understand who Chagall was as a man.
                    In the upper part there's him with his wife Bella flying over the world, regardless of everything
                    below them,
                    merged as if they where a single thing. <br>
                    Below them there's the city of Vitebsk, Chagall's native city. It is represented like grey and cold,
                    only one house
                    is coloured in red: his native home, where he was raised and loved as a child. <br>
                    The painting is intentionally schematic to represent the dreaming atmosphere that love causes: love
                    is
                    so strong that makes Marc and Bella estrange from the boring city-life.

                    <i><b>"Sc√®ne de Cirque"</b></i> combines many of Chagall's most iconic artistic elements: the bold
                    palette, the flowers,
                    the horse, and even a violin player.
                    He has always been fascinated by the circus because it took him into the parallel world of
                    subconscious.
                    From his childhood in Vitebsk to his life in Paris he frequently attended the circus.<br>
                    <i>"It is a magic world, the circus, a timeless dancing game where tears and smiles, the play of
                        arms and legs take the form of a great art."</i><br>
                    The characteristic blue background gives the work a dramatic atmosphere. The thick application of
                    paint on the bouquet of flowers is echoed by the equally physical
                    execution of the horse-riding woman's skirt. The scene is imbued with a palpable energy,
                    deriving from the circus's ambiguous identity as simultaneously fun-loving and tragic.

                    "<i><b>Le coq rouge dans la nuit</b></i>" is a deeply suggestive painting that Chagall
                    realized after his beloved wife died. It is interesting to notice that, in that dreaming
                    blue-coloured
                    atmosphere, the artist adds a <b>violin</b>, an element full of symbolism. Indeed, the violin is a
                    symbol of
                    communication with the Divine since it is considered the holder of the four natural elements's
                    music.
